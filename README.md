# 💪 Muscle Map

**Muscle Map** is a web application that helps users visualize the effectiveness of their workouts in targeting different muscle groups. 
By logging exercises, users receive a heatmap-style diagram showing which muscles are being worked the most
Enabling smarter training, better balance, and more effective progress tracking.
